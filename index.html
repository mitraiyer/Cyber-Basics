        <p>The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that represents Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.</p>
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Ensuring data privacy and limiting access to authorized users through encryption and access control.</p>
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>Maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness, often through hashing and validation techniques.</p>
            <h3>Availability</h3>
           <p>Ensuring that data and systems are accessible when needed, using redundancy and backup measures.</p>

        <!--info-->
        <p>Data can exist in three states: in transit, at rest, and in use. Each state requires different protection strategies.</p>
        <h3>Data in Transit</h3>
        <p>Data moving between systems, usually protected by encryption (e.g., HTTPS).</p>
        <h3>Data at Rest</h3>
        <p>Data stored on devices, often protected by encryption and physical security.</p>
        <h3>Data in Use</h3>
        <p>Data actively being processed; requires access control and monitoring.</p>

        <!--info-->
        <p>Authentication verifies user identities and can include methods like passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
        <h3>Passwords</h3>
        <p>A string of characters that can include numbers, special characters, and upper/lowercase characters. This is used to verify the identity of a user when they are being authenticated. </p>
        <h3>Biometrics</h3>
        <p>The automated recogintion of a user by their unique physical characteristics to verify them during the authenticatio process.</p>
        <h3>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
        <p>A security process that requires users to provide multiple methods of verification to get access to a service.</p>

        <h2 class ="section-title">Potential Threats</h2>
        <!--info-->
        <p>Cyber threats can pose a risk for many people. Here are the key potential threats in cybersecurity: </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Malware: Malicious softwrae that can steal, corrupt, or lock data, compromising systems. </li>
        <li>Social Engineering: Manipulative tactics that manipulate people into sharing information on how to bypass security protocols.</li>
        <li>Ransomware: A type of malware that locks files and demands payment for their release. </li>
        <li>DDoS Attacks: Distrubted Denail of Service that floods servers with traffic, causing disruptions and downtime.</li>
